# American opinion on factors negatively impacting environment and climate change

We use the US GSS 2021 - available here: https://gss.norc.org -> Get the data -> STATA -> 2021. That raw data is saved in inputs/data.

With increasing concerns toward the environment around the world, it is important to study the opinions of general public about the state of the declining health of the environment, and what people think about the known causes of the climate change. The paper will take the survey data from United States and analyze the reponses of the survey participants of United States to study the opinion of the public regarding the environmental issues.
